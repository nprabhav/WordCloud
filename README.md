 ## Description
 A word cloud is an image made of words that together resemble a cloudy shape.
 The size of a word shows how important it is e.g. how often it appears in a text â€” its frequency.

 People typically use word clouds to easily produce a summary of large documents (reports, speeches), to create art on a topic (gifts, displays) or to visualise data (tables, surveys).
